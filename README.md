In the code there are two libraries namely 
1.calculator_file(.cpp and .h) having class calculator.
2.computation_file(.cpp and .h)having class computation.
3. main.cpp for implementing above classes.
Now,
Compile the above code using command :- 

             cl calculator_file.cpp computation_file.cpp main.cpp
             
this will generate three .obj and one.exe file.
Now, Run the above code using command>>    

             calculator_file
